<h2>IRC: Places</h2>
<h3>The Abandon</h3>
A mysterious walled fortress, four miles wide and three stories tall, encompassing an unexplored and dangerous dungeon that goes down for miles, said to contain portals to other worlds. Merely entering its walls is a dangerous endeavor, and it is thought to have been built several millienia ago.
<h3>The Forest of Demons</h3>
-
<h3>Central City</h3>
The massive capitol city of the IRC, known for its large, fortress-like castle and high diversity. The city is surrounded by a well-defended wall.
<h3>Fort Milgauss</h3>
-
<h3>Steelmoon Contract Foundry</h3>
Almost the size of a planet itself, the Foundry is the major industrial center of the IRC. It is always heavily guarded, as it handlesmost of its parent country's military manufacturing. The ATF has yet to mount an assault on it, owing largely in part to the Startreader-class Star Dreadnought on guard at all times.
