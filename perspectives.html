"Human"
I think it started on YouTube. But where it started really doesn't matter, because the aftermath was not something anyone of us could escape-humans or them alike.
It was a challenge to all of us on Earth. Anyone or anything was capable of seeing their message to us if they tried hard enough. That was part of it.
"I don't know what will happen after this. I should hope that it turns  out well for everyone involved, but as we all know, life doesn't care and never will. To whom it will concern: You are not alone. You never have been. I doubt anyone watching this for few days after it gets posted will believe me, but here goes."
She sighed. A girl, with silver hair and pointy ears, spoke to us, with no regard for what would happen afterward. Wearing a military uniform, clad in achievements and insignias noone would be able to identify fo several decades, she pulled out a pocketknife and proceded to slit open her index finger, as if she was used to doing so. A black, almost shiny liquid dripped from the small wound.
"We are different than you. We are, by definition, not human. But because of this difference, we feel inclined to tell you that we come in peace. Yes, I know how stupidly cliched that is. How long that peace lasts is up to you. See, we've been leeching culture off of Earth for quite some time now, and most of us are rather fond of what you as a planet have accomplished."
"It has progressed to the point where you can actually find decent pizza shops in our capitol city. Oh yeah, for any of you Ithari watching this, those strict internet laws have run out, so yes, you can shitpost through the internet now."
"But that's beside the point. With this broadcast, we issue a challenge to the people of Earth: prepare yourselves for war with aliens, or cease to exist trying. We come in peace, but you won't be so lucky a second time. We like you, so get your shit together so  we don't have to worry about you. We know you're capable."
"There is no precedent for something like this, and I think we'd both benefit from cultural exchange. So we'll do this your way, and set up meetings with the appropriate leaders. If you don't believe me, turn your eyes to the heavens, as you have always done. What awaits you there is up to you."
The  girl drew her handgun from its holster and fired at the camera. The camera feed stopped, but she seemed unaware of the fact that the microphone was still active.
"Ugh, I need a beer." A brief pause. "Wait. Sergeant, why the hell are we still broadcasting!? Iirdessai, why haven't you stopped it-" 
The feed cut out. The world was shocked. The whole thing was livestreamed, so using special effects was unheard of. Within hours, astronomers had already identified a significant group of new celestial objects from outside of our solar system. The next day, we haad clear images of what looked to be a small fleet of starcraft straight from Star Wars. 
A week after that, the ships were replaced with a different, slightly larger fleet, with noticeably different design. Then came the meetings. It seemed they employed shipping companies to transport their teleporters, preventing their own personnel from being attacked. They arrived each time with a representative and a single unarmed attendant.
The representatives varied, but all were either of their royalty, military, or both, and were all fluently speaking English, having no discernable accent.
